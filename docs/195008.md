An alternative to k-means clustering is k - medoids clustering.

This algorithm chooses actual data points as centers, as opposed to choosing centroids (the mean of data points in a cluster) as centers.

Which of the following BEST describes why the k - mediods algorithm is often used over the k-means algorithm?

* I. The k - medoids algorithm runs faster than the k - means algorithm does
* II. The k - medoids algorithm is more robust to outliers than the k - means algorithm is
* III. It is easier to choose the value of k in the k - mediods algorithm than in the k - means algorithm

A. I only&#x20;

B. II only&#x20;

C. III only&#x20;

D. I and II only&#x20;

E. II and III only
