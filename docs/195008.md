An alternative to k-means clustering is k - medoids clustering. 

This algorithm chooses actual data points as centers, as opposed to choosing centroids (the mean of data points in a cluster) as centers. 

Which of the following BEST describes why the k - mediods algorithm is often used over the k-means algorithm?


- I. The k - medoids algorithm runs faster than the k - means algorithm does
- II. The k - medoids algorithm is more robust to outliers than the k - means algorithm is
- III. It is easier to choose the value of k in the k - mediods algorithm than in the k - means algorithm
