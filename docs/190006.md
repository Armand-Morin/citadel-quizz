# Machine Learning Model Fitting Techniques

Which of the following techniques are useful for improving the fitting process of machine learning models?

* I. Subtracting the mean from a set of data for natural language processing tasks
* II. Scaling and normalizing the features
* III. Imposing a regularization constraint to avoid overfitting
* IV. Performing a random hyperparameter search instead of a grid search to tune the model parameters

**Options:**

A. I, II, and III only

B. I, II, and IV only

C. I, III, and IV only

D. II, III, and IV only

E. I, II, III, and IV
