# Poisson Process Probability

Customers arrive at a shop according to a Poisson process with rate parameter $\lambda = 1$.

Suppose we observe customer arrivals from time $t = 0$ to time $t = T$, and find that only one customer arrived during this period.

**Question:** What is the probability that this single customer arrived between time $t = 0$ and time $t = T/4$?

**Options:**

A. $Te^{-T/4}/4$

B. $1-e^{-T/4}$

C. $1/4$

D. $e^{-T/4}$

E. None of the above
