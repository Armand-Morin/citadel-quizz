# Maximum Length Subarray

A subarray of array a is defined as a contiguous block of a's elements having a length that is less than or equal to the length of the array.

For example, the subarrays of array a = [1, 2, 3] are [1], [2], [3], [1, 2], [2, 3], and [1, 2, 3].

Given an integer, k = 3, the subarrays having elements that sum to a number ≤ k are [1], [2], and [1, 2]. The longest of these subarrays is [1, 2], which has a length of 2.

Given an array, a, determine its longest subarray that sums to less than or equal to a given value k.

## Function Description

Complete the function `maxLength` in the editor below. The function must return an integer that represents the length of the longest subarray of a that sums to a number ≤ k.

`maxLength` has the following parameter(s):
- `a[a[0],...a[n-1]]`: an array of integers
- `k`: an integer
