# Regularizers for Sparse Regression Parameters

Which of the following regularizers would be MOST useful for producing a sparse set of regression parameters?

**Options:**

A. $L_{0}$-norm (i.e., cardinality)

B. $L_{1}$-norm (i.e., sum of absolute values)

C. $L_{2}$-norm (i.e., Euclidean norm)

D. $L_{\infty}$-norm (i.e., the maximum value)

E. Frobenius Norm (i.e., matrix-induced Euclidean norm)
