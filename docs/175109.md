There are several books placed in the HackerStudy library. One of those books on mathematics described an interesting problem that a mathematician wishes to solve.


For an array arr of n integers, the mathematician can perform the following move on the array:

1. Choose an index i (0 â‰¤ i < length(arr)) and add arr[i] to their scores.
2. Discard either the left partition (i.e. arr[0, 1,... i - 1]) or the right partition (i.e. arr[i + 1, i + 2,... length(arr) -1]). The partition discarded can be empty too. The selected partition then becomes the new value of arr and is used for subsequent operations.


Starting with an initial score of 0, the mathematician wishes to find the maximum achievable score after k moves.


**Example**
Consider n = 6, arr = [4, 6, -10, -1, 10, -20], and k = 4

One optimal way the mathematician can perform the moves is as follows.

- Select arr[4], (0-based) then the left subarray. Now, score = 10 and arr = [4, 6, -10, -1].
- Select the 0th element and then the right subarray. Now, score = 10 + 14 = 14 and arr = [6, -10, -1].
- Select the 0th element and then the right subarray. Now, score = 14 +6 = 20 and arr = [-10, -1].
- Select the 1st element and the right subarray. Now, score = 20 + -1 = 19 and arr = [].

Thus, the answer is 19.
