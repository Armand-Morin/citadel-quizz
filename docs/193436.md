# Logistic Regression on Non-Linear Data

You have a synthetic dataset with two classes A and B separated by the unit circle (a non-linear decision boundary).

**Question:** Which of the following statements MOST accurately describes how a logistic regression model would perform in classifying this dataset?

**Options:**

A. The accuracy of such a model will always be close to zero

B. The accuracy of such a model will always be close to one

C. The model will most likely perform poorly since logistic regression is mathematically equivalent to a linear regression model, which does not handle non-linear decision boundaries very well

D. The model should be able to separate the two classes and generalize well if we transform the feature space to include the squared feature values

E. The model may perform well on training set but can never generalize well to the test set
