# 190304

A government office has two officers handling people's requests. Suppose that the time between request arrivals at the first officer's desk is random and follows an exponential distribution with $\lambda = u\_1$. Similarly, the time between request arrivals at the second officer's desk is also random and follows an exponential distribution with $\lambda = u\_2$. The first officer has probability $p\_1$ of referring any request he receives to the office supervisor, and the second officer has probability $p\_2$ of doing so. What is the average time between requests referred to the supervisor?

A.&#x20;

$$
\frac{p_1}{u_1} + \frac{p_2}{u_2}
$$



B.&#x20;

$$
\frac{p_1 + p_2}{u_1 + u_2}
$$





C.&#x20;

$$
\frac{1}{u_1p_1 + u_2p_2}
$$





D.

$$
\frac{1}{p_1u_1} + \frac{1}{p_2u_2}
$$



E. None of the above
