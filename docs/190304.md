# Arrival Process Problem

A government office has two officers handling people's requests. Suppose that the time between request arrivals at the first officer's desk is random and follows an exponential distribution with $\lambda = u_1$. Similarly, the time between request arrivals at the second officer's desk is also random and follows an exponential distribution with $\lambda = u_2$. 

The first officer has probability $p_1$ of referring any request he receives to the office supervisor, and the second officer has probability $p_2$ of doing so. 

**Question:** What is the average time between requests referred to the supervisor?

**Options:**

A. $$\frac{p_1}{u_1} + \frac{p_2}{u_2}$$

B. $$\frac{p_1 + p_2}{u_1 + u_2}$$

C. $$\frac{1}{u_1p_1 + u_2p_2}$$

D. $$\frac{1}{p_1u_1} + \frac{1}{p_2u_2}$$

E. None of the above
